[russia] most recent examples would be you installing abm shield , russia deploying iskanders  poland wants a better gas prices  russia and germany build nord stream .
[russia] still , putin is a pretty brazen devil , he knows ukraine would never use nukes because russia has enough to flatten every square kilometre of ukraine into radioactive ash .
[russia] too much of little things like puns , blunt statements about invading someone , random mentioning of facts or events , but they hold no significant value , because they wo nt happen any time soon  so there is no point in actually saying anything like that  .

[us] it s simply a way to distinguish someone taking into account their cultural upbringing and to give an idea as to the kinds of discrimination they ve historically and currently face .
[us] i would nt take anything in the youtube comments seriously , it s the same place where proputin shit gets liked a ton , contrary to real life opinion .

[us] i mean norway had a little bit of exploring in the world on their end in history but it is insignificant compared to the massive amounts done by other western countries .
[us] i only offered the comparison of either or because you were saying usa is nt diverse enough while defending russia as a proper government that the people want .
[russia] though the author in some points tries too much to manipulate the facts under his theory   the only one that has as such support is navalny  but that s only because it sometimes happens to him snarl on  black  , mention something about a great russia and throw meat .
[us] however , this theory is contrary to human and animal studies that in a nerve transaction with amputation of the distal tissue , the proximal nerve undergoes acute axonal swelling .
[russia] for example with crimea we ruined relations with ukraine for a long time , scared finland , gave an excuse for china for future  protection of oppressed minorities  possibly on russian turf as well , created points of tension in relations with central asian republics  belarus and kazakhstan  eurasian union used to be somewhat voluntarily organization , now we are  messing  with other nation borders , which makes you wonder  .

[us] they hypothesize that a large solar storm  as large as the  carrington event  solar storm in 1859 , which was before global energy grid existed  would  as they have in the past , but much more extensively  cause failure of a great many high voltage transformers , huge and very expensive power transformers which take years to replace   the global manufacturing capacity is fairly limited .
[us] data published by the federal statistics office on thursday   9 october   indicated that exports slumped by 5.8 percent between july and august , the sharpest monthly fall since 2009 , at the height of the financial crisis .

[russia] however lately i almost do nt readwatch russian media  except for few sites  because there are almost no sources of information which do nt look like disgusting propaganda and i ve seen how under its pressure even smart people start to use terms  mercenaries  ,  fascists  ,  nazis  , etc.
[russia] also , us did plenty of its landgrabbing and also ethnic cleansing of the natives , something which russia never did  in fact , they were nt even forced to assimilate  .
[russia] central government in kiev was weak and disorganizedstate of chaos , crimeans took an opportunity  with help from  polite green men   and voted the fuck out of ukraine .
[russia] it seems though that s outskirts of the city , there are only two civilian buildings visible including the church  if it is the church  .
[russia] ukraine also falls under this category , they are a weird bunch and when they start shitting on everything russian and treat folks like bandera a hero , gas prises rise and trade barriers are implemented , when they are chill  no problems .
[russia] every big blogger now need to register   and other stuff like that showed there is no hope for democratic society , we are going back to ussr .

[russia] no , i can see how the slaughter of polish intelligence and the invasion of czechoslovakia pissed people off but the monument erected in sofia is not dedicated to the nkvd or the soldiers of the 1960 s .

[us] overall , it seems somewhat naive to think that corruption can be preventedsolved by declaring independence from the rest of spain , especially considering that the eu itself released  a study   httpec.europa.euregionalpolicysourcesdocgenerwork201202governance.pdf  that pointed out catalonia as one of the most corrupt regions in the eu .
[us] often , after actually  listening  to what people in older generations were saying , i begrudgingly realized they were right along a broad spectrum of issues .
[russia] if nato never expanded , putin would be content sitting in russia as he was , the guy s got an inferiority complex about russia , he wants to revenge the west for the humiliations of the 90s and early 2000s when russia was powerless and got pushed around , when it saw serbia , one of its most ancient and crucial allies lose kosovo on the same premise , without russia being able to do anything .

[us] on another note , i was eating at a greek place a while back and ordered a turkish coffee , only to be told quite angrily that ,  like many other things , the greeks invented this style of coffee , and the turks merely appropriated .
[russia] those people who argue in english mostly about politics , economy and all that things in detail , how do you imagine them not knowing about some very basic things which they do nt need a foreign language or an obscure source to learn about
[russia] westerners are at a huge risk of shakedowns , the russian police know how to scare sheltered westerners  and they will think that you re rich because obviously every westerner is a millionaire ...
[russia] funny how the unbiased media you hold in such high regard has nt mentioned the sacking of generals and the establishment of armed nazi gangs as official government forces .
[russia] what s so hard about trilateral agreement that allows ukraine to align more proeu and at the same time does nt harms relations with russia
[russia] en     httpwww.bbc.comsport0tennis29497035   putin pardoned a fsb officer imprisoned 2 years ago for 11 years for killing one person and injuring others in a drunk fight on a gas station .
[us] i do nt think it s something that we should be seriously concerned about now , but in a generation or twenty years it could be a very real possibility if europe does nt up it s military spending andor strengthen eu military integration .
[russia] article in russian   httptop.rbc.rusociety16092014949378.shtmlxtoralinternaltrafficrbc.rumainbodyitem4  explain how midrange bombers  tu22m   httpen.wikipedia.orgwikitupolevtu22m  maywill be deployed in crimea to  potentially  bomb romania and neutralize nato antimissile defense  for follow up icbm launch probably  .
[russia] after it became obvious that japan is getting down into war with us and ca nt support germany in russia , these forces were relocated and joined fight for moscow .
[us] the u.s. constantly talks about its  pivot to the east  aka were tired of defending you europe you re big boys now act like it , but we do it because of your inability to do so and to protect the baltic s because that would be the front line .
[russia] for the syrian civil war civilian  deaths in the hundred  s  of thousands  , iraki civil war  twelwe thousand  central african republic war  thousands  , boko haram killings ,  a few thousand  , etc.
[us] the economy hit its nadir in 1998 and was already on an upward trajectory when putin took over , and has benefited from the rising price of oil .
[us] one does nt have to look far into europe s or especially , china s 4000 year long recorded past to see the pattern .
[russia] it is possible that if he and other traitors such as gorbachev slowed down the reforms and stayed away from the disastrous  shock  policy , we could be seeing a modern , happy , politically free and economically viable ussr , one without the iron curtain and one that does nt need to plunder eastern europe to exist .
[us] the timing of all of this was such that they were able to get  though various means  yeltsin to agree publicly and in writing that russia is ok with them joining nato , even though they were nt .
[russia] i believe i provided you with video footage of maidan activists being armed with combat weapon precisely the days of  action  , as far as i can tell , this does not look like child toys , but a combat weapons being actively used .
[russia] but simple folk in europe and us thought that you actually want something else , it s not just about classical nationalistic  ukraine for ukrainians  and all that stuff .
[russia] the sovereign country democratically decides to do whatever it has every right to do on it s own territory , without breaking any treaties  with renegotiating , sure  , without breaking any trusts or doing anything even remotely amoral .
[us] like i said , i d prefer the universities be depoliticized , but as long as politics are so integral to the educational paradigm , my hope is that the issue of radical islam  not just isis  is given much greater critical scrutiny .
[russia] russian history is dark and full of misery , sometimes i wonder if we exported this to places like finland and eastern europe or they were that way in the first place .
[us] it has a lot to do with gats , which both the uk and us signed and endorsed . . because the us and some elements in the eu , push these ftas very aggressively .
[russia] when the smimoff runs out , it turns out the jeep s wrecked , the office is awash with puke and the loan is due for repayment .
[us] no doubt opportunities will be created for increased transatlantic trade , but what we may need to sacrifice in reaching that goal could be substantial .
[us] though it s flattering to be painted as the mastermind of this i do nt think the us has much to do with it .
[russia] russians are extremely racist against other russians from different regions it s only a thing in moscow , less in st.petersburg , the reason is the state supported inequality .
[russia] and as much as i love me some lithuanian sausages and mantinga bread , russian government is unlikely to follow lithuanian government s decisions .
[us] they were then forced to resort to using polluted river water , resulting in an outbreak of cholera that has claimed at least 32 lives .
[russia] , but also due to fact that their colleagues from other parts of economy have a terrible track record  oil , mining , banking industry , electricity and many others  , they are often not held accountable at all .

[us] we do nt need more land  the us is largely empty  , we do nt need ports or access to this sea or that sea , and we do nt need more political influence or allies .
[us] he also was nt truly elected in 2000 which was complete bullshit , but usa is nt going to have a civil war over it .
[russia] my longheld conviction is that many westerners , including the vast majority here , would like nothing better than to fight china to the last russian  and vice versa  , so that their hegemony over the world can last for yet another century .
[russia] i guess right now government is trying to form a political ideology and structure within the society to protect their  stolen  capitals which they had to return into the country after threat of sanctions .
[russia] i always thought his strategy in the east of ukraine was to escalate it as much as possible until in the end he swoops in like a generous peacekeeper .
[russia] the wife removed all posts about his death , and posted new status claiming that  her husband is alive and well , celebrating name day of my daughter  .
[russia] it s going to be taking terms from imf and the terms will be harsh , because the budget has to be set right again .
[russia] defacto it s a zone of military conflict and has good potential for terrorist   freedom fighters  activity so there is a lot of military and fsb personnel accompanied by excessive security measures and higher criminal activity due to lack of properly functioning police which is being restructured from ukrainian to russian  business processes  .
[us] i do come here though to get more in touch about european topics with europeans well i honestly do not know what can be done about that .
[us] new york is nt as important as london or hong kong internationally , but still does get a lot of active international work , like the alibaba ipo .
[us] so many cures , so many advances , and a colonization of mars and beyond could have been achieved if we had our priorities straight .
[russia] unfortunately i am no specialist in weapon manufacture , but i would have to guess that if you shoot at someone  thus putting your life at risk  you are not doing this with baby guns and intend to do serious damage .
[us] still , we should not confuse russian  fear  of the world , as its efforts to measure the threat as an indication of irrationality , but the opposite .
[us] sure sometimes there are definite needs to hold back certain industries  like trying to make laser weapons to skirt gun legislation for example  , but when it comes to evolutionary steps like leveraging smartphones , realtime location , and peerratings to select your ride home , it should nt be dismissed as  oh that s illegal  .
[russia] if we resort to china again , we will get crap  and expensive one  , beggars cant be choosers  it was also somewhat funny to read that russia imports 8090  of seeds for potato from netherlands or something , talk about   lets help our agricultural sector  and other things like sperm from animals to produce meat etc.
[russia] they do this even though it s pretty much granted that the ukrainian army is nt going to just let any separatists go if it captures them .
[russia] i m actually a russian , tho i ve lived in the us for awhile in the past and went to college there and still got here frequently for work .
[us] the point i am making is that you are suggesting highly centralized power that does nt even exist in a country like usa which is one large country instead of a weak confederation of european countries .
[russia] if i was an owner of air travel company  i d reroute all planes to stay away from russian air space  or at least away from caucasus  southern russia region  .
[us] obviously since i have health insurance i paid like  15 total for the experience in the us , but the total bill before insurance was over  280 .
[russia] because you never know  how many russians needed for putin to  protect  them in your country and how many  useless  countries nato is willing to give up in exchange for russian gas
[us] instead of waiting for older generations to die off , we should use them as an invaluable source of knowledge and decades of real life experience .
[russia] alternatively , the other side of the coin is that poland was notoriously bad when it comes to friends and pretty much pissed off everyone around them to a certain degree  polish opportunism resulted in poland being fucked up by other big nations over and over and over again .
[russia] my salary is getting less and less attractive compared to the european ones , i now earn as much as i would in a similar position in vienna , except the income tax here is lower and i do nt have to rent .
[russia] but that chain will go on unless we ll start trying to understand each other , but it s not the case with  reurope , it s not about understanding .
[russia] all you did was move the frontline of wwii a couple hundred miles west , making the main victims wwii the poles , belarusians , ukrainians and jews instead of russians .
[russia] it s easy to manage with frozen snow when it constantly under 10 c  just move it somewhere else and made 10m snow slide  exactly under my window  .
[us] well unemployment is at 6.1  and falling , and our last quarter gdp growth was better than  china  , so i do nt think that s a likely scenario .
[russia] nonetheless , its pretty obvious that i am a backwards barbarian who has no right to sit at the dining table , i will go back to my dog kernel , since  no russians are allowed  in the restaurant .
[russia] also it s not a  single guy from vk  but a youtube account with no videos but high quality antiukrainian propaganda , with a link to vk group devoted to proputin , antiwestern , antiukrainian and antiopposition content which was created right after maidan .
[russia] the tagliavini commission concluded that while georgia could have responded to the separatist attacks , it could not justify the full scale attack on tskhinvali .
[us] no , we spend that money to keep your continent out of war with russia , and therefore able to grow economically and trade with the us .
[us] there s a military submarine far inside of a country s territory , which is technically an act of war ... and that s the end of it .
[russia] paet was poorly informed and based his thoughts on hearsay  funny thing that even hearsay he based his opinion on  did nt support  his claims  .
[us] europeans down here are something you may come across once in your lifetime unless you go to an international city or a city they visit a lot  new orleans ... europeans have been all over the place every time i ve gone to nola  .
[us] this is a story that shows how there is no longer any attempt to prevent or have accountability for these huge extra costs which are not covered by insurance .
[us] i never see  neo  associated with anything good , and it typically is used to taint an ideologyview without having to actually come up with a valid criticism about it .
[us] and then in some cases wait long periods , up to 20 years , i was told recently for the withdrawal to have effect .
[us] so you re telling me if you get shot or come down with ebola you re going to not be able to get care in the united states
[us] it s because most crashes do nt involve the plane plummeting out of the sky at cruising altitude , they happen pretty close to regular takeoff and landing .
[us] partly because i do nt want to to be perceived as some outsider jumping in to offer his opinion on european stuff and partly because i know my flair makes everything i post much more likely to be taken negatively .
[russia] i wish no one would want to live here , there d be no traffic jams and i d be able to find a seat in the metro during rush hours .
[russia] out of curiosity i followed euromaidaneuromaidanpr twitters and links provided to opposition sites , almost daily there were speculations , accusations , blatant lies with a general notion of  evil russia is coming for you   .
[russia] there is difference between being responsible for evil doing as a political leader , and being actual evil doer  and i m  not  saying that former is somehow better  or  worse  .
[russia] second , it s either this , or nato base in crimea in several years that completely controls russia s access to black sea .
[us] that really does nt matter worth a damn , and does nt give them the right to provoke wars in other countries on their border .
[russia] i believe it will be wasting of time  their primary work  besides espionage  is to help their own citizen , not to hand out documents left and right to everyone who s asking .
[us] different states of the us hardly shared the same language and religion , and i m pretty sure austria is still independent from germany , and the unified modern holy roman empire was never going to be a thing .
[us] people tend to forget just how scary nuclear warfare is , and just how long western leaders will have to think of it s cost if , for say , russia launches a lightening strikes on the baltics and deploys tactical nukes there with the threat of using them if the eu tries to dislodge them conventionally .
[us] nus does not support isis and a new motion will be taken to the next nus national executive committee meeting , which will specifically condemn the politics and methods of isis and offer solidarity for the kurdish people .
[us] absolutely pathetic how bitter and angry some of the posters are on here when i can get downvoted for stating simple facts within seconds of posting a comment .
[russia] those ukrainians out in the street that had legitimate complaints and were being killed by the government for protesting were all bought off by cia .
[us] dominant military powers do nt commit terrorism ask that of the people that are on the receiving end of a dominant military power s munitions .
[russia] soviet navy was almost nonexistent in pacific region at the time and if you would like an example of russia failing miserable , look no further than russojapanese war of early xx century .
[russia] apparently they are more trustworthy than all major russian pollsters  during last elections of mayor of moscow this sociological service was the only one whos poll results were close to actual election results .
[us] outright ethnic cleansing in croatia made nato declare an arms embargo on that country for a little while , but two decades later , croatia is a full member of the eu and nato .
[us] hell is where the police are german , the chefs are british , the mechanics are french , the lovers are swiss ,  and it is all organized by the italians
[russia] i really do nt understand russian logic  russian imperialism dictates to conquer all the orthodox , slavic or generically eastern european lands because they re similar .
[us] sometimes i believe that the us could still learn a lot from european nations you re right , and european nations could also learn a lot from the us .
[russia] i am not sure i understand guillotine clause correctly , basically if swiss refuse to vote the way eu wants , all previous treaties might be reworked  which would fuck up economy as far as i understand
[russia] russia is , after all , indeed quite corrupt even now , and just a couple decades ago it was , frankly speaking , a hellhole .
[russia] as for mostly asian roots of russian culture and state  here is interesting fact  serfdom in ussrrussia was defacto abolished only in  1960s   population of rural areas could nt receive internal passports to move freely within the country before 60s  .
[russia] what if this was an operation by russian counterintelligence who  overstepped their boundaries   or did not care about a  small  violation from their perspective  and not directly orchestrated by putin sitting in a war room behind the monitor with intense look on his face
[us] see arendt  the origins of totalitarianism    httparchive.orgdetailsoriginsoftotalit00aren  2nd chapter onward  the way they see public healthcare is identical to the domino theory advanced in the 1970s and 1980s to justify us support of right wing dictatorships around the world .
[us] you know , when you pay to entrench a single family in the upper crust of your society  give them frequent contact with the upper echelons of your government
[us] germany s trade surplus is damaging for the same reason cutting food stamps and unemployment benefits in america destroys jobs  and republican politicians are about as receptive as german officials to anyone who tries to point out their error .
[us] this guy had to spend years in a burn center and simply trying to get back to some semblance of a normal life  in his mid twenties  .
[us] whether you like it or not , or want to admit it or not , making switzerland or norway the 51st state would alienate the european union   or at least it s leadership   .
[us] nuclear waste container failure is a major issue right now , due to the failure of at least one of the very high tech containers inside of an underground storage facility  a salt cavern  here in the us , that was supposed to last for thousands of years .
[us] i m sure that google has complied with national laws as required , just like they ve complied with the eu s silly right to be forgotten law .
[us] the us and eu need to start doing more to militarily arm former soviet republics , ideally with nuclear weapons as a detergent  if they do nt have them already  .
[russia] with a referendum scheduled for may 25  one that the russian crimeans were sure to  win   things were coming along swimmingly as they were .
[us] if people are so damn bad that we need the threat of force to maintain order , then they are also too bad to be in positions with the authority to enforce order .
[russia] either i ll get papers which will instantly make me an illegal alien  or i ll have to go without any papers at all , as a person which does not exist .
[us] not only are they far removed from other parts of the states in which they reside , but they are recognized as sovereign nations and are in charge of their own affairs .
[us] for example , many lithuanians have difficulty grasping basic logical and scientific concepts , as well as complex social processes , and thus blame things on genetics when there is no evidence for it .
[russia] this time the west must make mr putin see that , with this havoc at the heart of europe , he has gone too far .
[russia] to counter the assertion of an  inexorable rise  in death rates , he would need to provide a chart with data going back to at least 1960 .
[us] if we did nt want the european union to exist in it s present form we would ve sabotaged it sometime during the past halfacentury instead of encouraged  fostered it s growth .
[russia] yep , georgia tried to force abkhazia to stay , abkhazians responded violently  and btw it was cleansing of  nonabkhazians  , not just georgians , although they suffered most of it  .
[us] an economist would be the first to tell you that they are not scientists , and they know that their models are not going to be perfect .
[russia] this time in sloviansk according to exit polls  opposition bloc 28  , cpu 13  , tyhipko 5  vs bpp 19  , pf 8  , radicals 7  , samopomich 5  , batkyv 2  , svoboda 2  .
[us] that  does nt  mean i m saying they should be rewarded or allowed to stay , just that it s easy to sit comfortably in a first world nation and pass judgement on people trying to escape unimaginable poverty .
[russia] lets not bring up that inconvenient history about all of russia s neighbors invading it historically and even annexing some parts of it for a time , yes
[us] this is very true , and its also a good reason why , on some issues , folks on  reurope should realize that some of us from the us are trying to help europe avoid some of what s happened here .
[us] look when i talk about eu and payback i am not trying to make it seem like eu is evil or any of that nonsense .
[russia] russia is  threatening  and ukraine with  economic warfare  as yatsenyuk said , but he knows he s making empty talk because russia is merely cutting the subsidies that ukraine has been getting on gas prices .
[russia] it s very interesting to hear russians are now one people with  polygamous chechens   httpeeaesem2011oslo.orgnecessarilychangethelegislationvisany  and buriats to whom kremlin has deprived the  visit of their highest religious leader  dalai lama   httpblogs.voanews.comrussiawatch20110712whycantthedalailamavisitrussia  .
[russia] if you want numbers  although i am not investoreconomist or smtn , so take it for whats it worth  i would say that russia this year  in best possible scenario  would have 0,30 ,5  of gdp increase .
[russia] by boris akunin , did nt read it but i do nt expect it to be antiukraine as the author is a huge oppositionist to putin .
[us] reminds me of the   national city lines   privatization disasters in the us  or how the us went from having the best public transit in the developed world to the worst in only 30 years
[russia] i know there were other  precedents  or  special cases  in the past , in the end west has shown the way   might makes right  and international law means jack shit , if you can not enforce it .
[russia] russia , if you remember , has  2x gdp per capita   httpswww.cia.govlibrarypublicationstheworldfactbookrankorder2004rank.html  , a far more robust jobs market  i have a lot of ukrainian friends who work in russia  and overall russia despite all its lack of freedom is still a more economically viable nation than ukraine .
[russia] another young man , who was not a representative of the lgbt community , has been removed from the venue by police at the request of the organizers , as he handed out leaflets with nationalistic themes .
[russia] people starve to death in a capitalist world by the tens of millions , but we re responsible for the actions of right wing dictators in a state capitalist buffer state when the current governments in europe that you continue to elect are nt responsible for their ongiong crimes against the third world
[russia] dismissal of an independent chief and appointment of a controlled person , including directly controlled from the kremlin offices  is a violation of the law on the media talking about the inadmissibility of censorship .
[us] while there are many who are willing to die for their cause , that s not the case with the majority of the supporters in europe .
[russia] i posted my views back when euromaidan only started and wondered why we even need them and what are our long term strategical goals or directives .
[us] eulevel isds has never been impactassessed  isds is a new eu level policy that can result in billions of euros flowing from eu citizens to foreign corporations in the future .
[russia] at the moment full  unofficial  prohibition to leave the country is covering fsb   30k people  , police   1m  , army  220k officers  , president s  management company   100k  , various bureaucrats   1m  .
[russia] but been shown this  aggression  from western countries in a certain light they tend to start seeing him as a protector and his actions to be just .
[us] and i do nt disagree with that but there s a difference between valid criticism of these industries and full blown hysteria  shut it all down  that s been shoved in my mouth by numerous people throughout this thread .
[us] this situation described in this article would get laughed out of the office so fast that the bride would nt even have time to pack her bags before she would be deported .
[russia] in the usa it s widely believed that the japanese were scared by atomic bombs dropped on august 6 and 9 august 1945 on hiroshima and nagasaki .
[us] to condemn the is and support the kurdish forces fighting against it , while expressing no confidence or trust in the us military intervention .
[russia] soviet people were indeed heroes and liberators , i am not talking about stalin and co , i am talking about ordinary soviet soldiers who shed blood for the world .
[russia] i m perfectly capable of agreeing with you that it was nt different because i do nt frankly care about arguing precisely how evil stalin was , i m not a stalinist apologist .
[us] there were other justifications , such as  wmd s  , which turned out not to be there , but in any event , i was very much  very much  against iraq .
[us] if we want a stable iraq , we should ve stayed or we should go back and commit ourselves to a generation   20 years   long occupation .
[us] with european policymakers still struggling to save the continent s common currency from ruin , they must now confront what could be an even bigger economic problem .
[russia] it s him 20 years ago , when he was helping his comrades in chechnya fighting russians , he s stating that his enemies are communists , jews and russians .
[us] i dont remember exactly what he said , be he said  more or less  that he was fleeing russia , and was worried about being jailed for trying to leave
[russia] it seems some of ukrainian military groups which tried to escape had captured russian soldiers with them  and they were killed by russian troops along with ukrainians .
[us] and then that brought me to thinking about how many people are treated differently in europe while in the us they would nt be treated differently so i decided to make a post saying if anyone has tried living in western europe and has had problems like that , they should try the us instead where they would nt be treated negatively for things like being eastern european or having read hair , or being a roma just saying they would probably be more welcomed here .
[russia] that said , if i did live there , i would definitely vote for them , as they seem to be the only party that  1  would stem the assault of third world hordes into that once green and pleasant land , and  2  are nt crazy neonazis like the bnp .
[us] should we vote for the party that is most likely to do things that will piss us off the least , and thus have at least a minor impact in making politics less completely terrible
[us] what s less sure is how much power can be projected at the other side of the globe with sane defence budgets , and that s why us hawks always push that talking point .
[us] i have seen the different pricing for cash or card at gas stations , but that seems like a silly thing to pay for in cash .
[russia] if a strict legal definition is adopted , based on the un genocide convention , genocide against the ukrainians in 1932  33 is a charge for which there is some evidence , but it seems to the present author that it does not meet the standard of specific intent required to prove genocide .
[us] being the most stable country in the world with the most desired currency in the world and the most secure country are all bad .
[russia] in case of russian gas and oil , they are priced by the global markets , they are not cheap for europeans , they do nt bring any competitive advantage to european industries .
[russia] stalin was a paranoid dictator , he executed thousands that were innocent and caused the death of a few million who were almost mostly innocent .
[russia] if yanukovich is russia s man , then why the fuck did he throw fuel into the fire with all the eu association talks , constant promises and so on
[russia] they voted a number of times before for autonomy from ukraine , in return ukraine refused to listen to those votes and abolished the post of president of crimea , and the crimean constitution .
[russia] however , they have blended in a lot with the settlers so pretty much everyone there claims ethnic status even when they are not because its hard to disprove and they get some government benefits .
[us] from their platform    we support efforts to help lowincome individuals get a fair chance based on their potential and individual merit  but we reject preferences , quotas , and setasides , as the best or sole methods through which fairness can be achieved , whether in government , education or corporate boardrooms ... merit , ability , aptitude , and results should be the factors that determine advancement in our society .  tl  dr republicans are against , not for affirmative action
[us] i have trouble saying anything positive about the situation other than it is a random little town that no one gives a shit about .
[us] notably , oconnor s opinion did not claim to apply a higher level of scrutiny than mere rational basis , and the court has not extended suspectclass status to sexual orientation .
[russia] there is a russian joke for that   once upon a time ambassadors of united states , france , spain , germany and denmark  secretary of state staff member victoria nuland  american senators cris merphy and john mccain  minister of foreign relations of germany guido westerwelle  high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy catherine ashton  former georgian president mikhail saakashvili  minister of foreign affairs of netherlands frans timmermans  european mp yacek protacevich  minister of foreign affairs of lithuania linas linkyavichous  speaker of lithuanian seim loretta grauzhinene  former prime minister of poland yaroslav kazcynski  senator of czech republic yaromir shtenina gathered on maidan and  accused russia of meddling in ukraine internal affairs .
[us] if your beef is with pp , then work to throw the pp out of power  or  and i m asking seriously  have the people in psoe and podemos been as much anticatalan as people here are claiming about pp
[us] the worst in europe  and i think even the world  is bosnia and herzegovina , but part of the problem there is it  is nt  known how many landmines there are .
[us] people are proud of where they came from and i guess think that , conversely ,  actual  irish would be proud of the ancestors of their kin that have thrived .
[russia] i am sure people on the streets of crimea and sevastopol who celebrated their independence from kiev were all held at a gunpoint and forced by evil russkies .
[russia] the facts that cheka shot tens of thousands of people without a trial and that the majority of russian intellectuals were killed , pursued and sent away from the country .
[us] the most ridiculous effect in all this are the europeans that are nt russian that jump to putin s defense because of their hatred of usa .
[russia] there are things that reurope would want to see i am sure of , but domestically would be a disaster or immediate radicalization of society , which is not a good thing in our current political climate .
[russia] httpen.wikipedia.orgwikilgbthistoryinrussialgbtrightsfollowingtherevolution1917.e2.80.931933 tl  dr  it was not the provisional government but the bolsheviks who legalised homosexuality  it was not a cause for them to reverse that until stalin s strengthening of the central power over the society .
[us] i think more people would ride bikes instead of using their cars if a. we had a real bike lane and b. everything was nt so damn far apart .
[russia] neither  malka  nor  malusha  are nt russianslavic names and afaik from thousand  years of history of russia  malusha  appears only once  as the name of vladimir s mother .
[russia] for example , you can leave your milk cooking on the stove with the words  avos it wo nt boil  , even though you do nt know how close it is to the boiling point and if you ll be gone a sufficiently short amount of time .
[russia] america already enjoys high popularity abroad , if it can cut down on its military actions , it can gain a lot more international alliances .
[russia] edit  meanwhile  ukrainian airborne unit is blocked in southern town nikolaev   httplenta.runews20140302block  by antimaidan protesters  after troopers have tried to advance to guard military weapon storage nearby .
[us] however , the loss of the stabilityproducing us military could lead to  flash points  that are not big enough for fullscale us military presence , but are little conflicts around europe that would otherwise not happened .
[us] it makes you guys write things like  we would not allow trans fatty acids even though , your beloved doener kababs are  loaded with them .
[us] in most cases  perhaps i should nt have said  every   , probably , if such gifts are given by the class which they perceive to be oppressing them , and for what they may perceive to be ulterior motives .
[us] because you ve admitted it multiple times , and you even admitted it when i confronted you a week or two ago about it .
[russia] they may call them terrorists , but they know that the city is nt being held hostage , they know it s actively resisting .
[us] i ll add that during my 200405 deployment i was not personally impressed with the  apparent  maintenance level the rn gave it s ships , at least compared to american and australian vessels .
[russia] i do nt give a shit about anyone being gay , but what i do give a shit about is deliberate misleading campaigns engineered by 3rd parties , which has nothing to do with reality on the ground .
[us] this is all true , but i venture to say that the northern irish unionists are far more religious than most in the netherlands  outside your bible belt maybe  .
[russia] or interview with commander of motorized platoon who admitted they were near tskhinvali for like a day before they were allowed to break their disguise to protect whatever left from peacekeepers
[russia] i thought he would be a bit more rational though , meaning take crimea , stir some shit up in southeast ukraine and back out to let europe  u.s save face , but the  play  has turned into  drama  already .
[us] so , as i understand it ... being in the eu allows you to live and work anywhere and schengen is a noneu treaty which simply allows for the free movement of persons  but does not allow you to livework in any eu country
[us] 3 countries will likely end up having to exempt their services explicitly ,   unless there are no services similar to the ones involved   httpswww.opendemocracy.netournhsjohnhilaryonttipandnhstheyaretryingtobamboozleus  being sold at all  , otherwise the same broad mandatory privatization and  extremely narrow exemptions   httpwww.iatp.orgfilesgatsandpublicservicesystems.htm  as gats applies .
[russia] late autumn in a gloomy weather adds a lot to depressiveness of that video and of course you can find a right place to enjoy a shiny summer , like  the volga embarkment   httpwww.youtube.comwatchvrfe4l5navz8  , but it s not like any weather can help those views of dirty streets which are 99  of the city .
[russia] 64 proyanukovich  senators have fled from kiev   httplenta.runews20140221flee  and  parliament voted to stop  antiterrorism  operation   httpitartass.commezhdunarodnayapanorama989805   return all military forces  including  berkut   into barracks .
[russia] i never implied personal responsibility  unless you actually personally took part in that criminal invasion of abkhazia  , and there is nt a single phrase of mine from which you can draw that conclusion .
[russia] ...  danko  if you think that it s a victory , i ll say that it s a worst defeat of the european union .
[russia] by the way some of those truly propagandafree shows were maximovskaya s work back on old ntv until it was closed , then on tvs until it was closed , and even though her rentv show was clearly  self  censured it still was the best news show on mainstream tv .
[russia] someone had to pay the price for our  relatively  free future   tbh last 10 years of ussr were crappy with all those goods deficits , suppressed ethnic conflicts , sudden exchange of currency  .
[russia] i live in russia where i had to acquire foreign citizenship because i did nt want to brake the law and pay  4.5 k in bribes  common  tax  for russian citizenship  even though i m russian and born in russia and my parents are citizens  .
[us] i was nt allowed in the immediate room but i did follow the ob out to the room and stood just off to the side .
[us] my complaints are more when words like tee shirt are used when every damn language as a word for shirts , versus a word like internet being used .
[us] even worse is you thinking the communist party in china makes better allies than countries that are democracies and are currently military allies with usa .
[us] the us , uk , eu , as neoliberals from all these nations team up to use the  standstill  ratchet and isds to dismantle the public health care and safety nets and deregulate every possible protection which they can think up a cockamamie legal theory to  justify  to some overworked legislators who they  wont even let read the damn things except under surveillance   httpwww.ipwatch.org20140402ttipeucommissionerpointsfingeratussecrecyinvestorstateprovisions  .
[russia] if i was conspiracy theorist i d say germany is being manipulated and corrupted by kremlin and its abundant supply of oil and gas  like it happened with ukrainian government .
[russia] i mentioned previously that if ukrainians were to be smart , they wo nt push the whole  obey me  thing and give an opportunity for an honest vote  and their respective candidaterepresentative  and whatnot .
[us] they did it to force people to buy cars and to take the space that trolleys used to run in on streets for more cars , but it also arguably created the us s underclass .
[russia] using 2009 data , zak cope found that this methodology revealed about  5 trillion in value transfer between the third world and imperialist countries .
[russia] one of the reasons would also be the way west treated russia after soviet union collapse  something like  no one is forgotten , nothing is forgivenforgotten  .
[us] naturally , when palestinians rain rockets on southern israel or murder israelis in their homes , sympathy for the palestinians goes down , but israelis really do care about how checkpoints , the security barrier , etc.
[russia] prior to this , russia made  zero  noise or any moves at all , just quietly watched antirussian hysteria of euromaidan and people who shouted incredible amount of bullshit about russian tanks in kiev , chechens in buses and plenty of other shit , i watched live streams mostly and read what  leaders of euromaidan  said at the time , there was nothing good about russia there and plenty of hate speech .
[us] he still thinks that we should respect russia s sphere of influence rather than deny them it in order make russia feel better that it s not a superpower anymore .
[russia] name of the source is quite funny in my opinion  nonetheless , there is nothing to gain for eu either economically or politically via backing of the protesters , no considerable reputation damage as of  this moment  either .
[russia] does it not strike you as ironic that as you complain about russian propaganda you spam 247  reurope and  rukrainianconflict and  rworldnews with promaidan propaganda
[us] the patterns of warfare in the caucasus and the balkans in the 1990s resemble those on the indian subcontinent in the 1940s , those of eastern europe during and after the world war i , and so on .
[russia] so , russia must admit that it basically has lost what it considers as its own backyard or  sphere of influence  , pay the reparations  quietly roll over and die to its western overlords
[us] i think this is mentioned in the article i posted a link to in the previous thread about ttip and the fact that most of its gains are from one industry alone  i posted it yesterday . . read this paper which will give you the story up until early 2009    the potential impact of the world trade organization s general agreement on trade in services on health system reform and regulation in the united states   httpwww.pnhp.orgsitesdefaultfilesnick20skala20gat20and20health20reform.pdf   gats  signed in 1995 hadhas a  standstill  that freezes public services at the 1995 level , that is the high water mark of public services in the us that can not be exceeded . . tisa  i am pretty sure , actually  extends the 1995 standstill  . . all of the ftas have these standstill clauses .
[us] if germans wanted to take more responsibility , the us would evermore treat germany more as a peer , and there would be less and less for germans to be indignant about visavis the us , and then we could go towards germany becoming a  normal nation  again .
[us] russia did nt learn the lesson from the fall of the ussr that modern wars between developed nations  i m exempting the ones in terrorist shitholes  are fought and won economically rather than with military force .
[us] i m not sure why europeans complain about us being warmongering hegemonists yet are not willing to develop their own capabilities to become independent .
[russia] minister of agriculture is very important in ukraine too , but it s not a position from which you can project a lot of power .
[us] general agreement on tariffs and trade  gatt  article xi specically prohibits the use of export controls for any purposes and eliminates quantitative restrictions on imports and exports .
[russia] you can also use this alt accounts to troll , neglect , make fun of someone with valid points , basically nsagchq playbook of killing internet discussions from time to time .
[russia] of course , since such sanctions will actually hurt the eu instead of just pissing off russia , the eu does nt have the balls for them  yet  .
[us] on a side note about nurses , in the us , many doctors and nurses at us hospitals are not allowed to tell parents  that the surgery is elective  or explain that the word elective means nontherapeutic .
[us] you seem to be arguing against that , but you did nt give any sources for your opinion , and your response added up to  for me   europe as a whole is economically quite strong  instead of  europe is so strong the euro will take its place alongside the dollar as reserve currency  .
[us] you should nt fault newspapers for reporting something that important , or pretend that anybody can report such things without name calling because its a very important piece of information that people need to know .
[russia] they were in power for years already in one position or another , if you think that they are less corrupt than yanukovich then think again .
[russia] this summer , tune in for ...  cold warrior  if he ca nt drag the future into the past , he sure can drag the past into the future .
[us] i think it s safe to say that its loss will significantly weaken spain s international presence  and at the same time , a nation of 7 mil wo nt have much of a presence of its own .
[us] the implication behind your post is important  nobody thinks the settlers would stay because  nobody thinks jews would be safe in an independent palestine  .
[us] the heads of france s army , navy and air force , along with the military chiefofstaff , made the unprecedented threat at a meeting last week , according to defence sources .
[russia] there is no excuses like circumstances and choosing lesser evil or inability to change something or just simply being a human being  fuck no , excuses are for morally weak people .
[us] the europeans ethnically cleansing their countries of muslims is not taken seriously because a  nobody thinks the selfrighteous fingerwaggers who say that israel commits  genocide  by blowing up mostly empty houses have the spine to do worse in their own country , and b  ethnically cleansing europe of muslims would be a huge military undertaking given how many muslims there are and how deeplyrooted they are in defensible urban areas .
[us] httpblog.usni.org20130820chinasdefensebudgetgettingfatteronthebigmacindex  despite everyone trotting out the odd deal that some european country makes , russia still is buying most of their defense equipment from russian sources , and paying russian wages for procurement and rd .  each country has it s own nonshooty staff  intelligence apparatus , training command , logistics  that cuts deeply into the total defense budget .
[us] the tree ring record shows that every few hundred years , the southwest us suffers multidecades long droughts , httpwww.usatoday.comstoryweather20140902californiamegadrought14446195 what that means is that us s natural gas should be held in reserve as a buffer against the need to desalinate water and ship it hundreds of miles , because its clear that the southwest has these super droughts .
[russia] even if you hate russia and wish to see it fall apart and retreat back into its muscovite nucleus , it s the wrong way to go about things .
[us] the factories are highly mechanized and automated , but cutting a cow or pig into all the correct pieces has to be done by hand .
[us] no , i think you are showing yourself to be a fool for not seeing that they would never go to all this trouble to hide them and split them up into pieces , which are only revealed little bit by little bit , give them intentionally similar names , etc.
[russia] i probably am talking out of my ass , but i read in a newspaper last week that russia has enough for 78 years of full production at current capacity
[us] i ca nt even think of a country that does nt grow enough food for their own people  punishing  outside countries by not allowing their own citizens to buy outside food and causing inflation .
[us] there are rich people in your country that do nt benefit from giving out free healthcare to everyone or public schools and many other functions .
[russia] sorry for russian language source  httpwww.rosbalt.rumain201303211108516.html tldr  when foreign court orders to take property of russian citizen  which is located somewhere outside of russia  , there is a possibility that all costs will be compensated from russia s budget and as an answer our government can expropriate property of this country if there s any on russian soil .
[us] although i guess , if spain really wanted , they could try that route in the same spirit of china with it s whole   one country , two systems   setup in relation to hong kong .
[russia] you can try watching this for example  httpwww.youtube.comwatchvymoon8ujwne do you see that nice guy with the ak chanting that if their  enemies  wo nt leave their land they ll force them to
[russia] a russian who posts 90  of the time in  rukraina  of course , that s bs about 90  , i had been active on reddit for years before  rukraina even existed , but yeah , i post there under  st. petersburg  flair .
[russia] mind you , the first postyeltsin elections was held in russia a bit later , after explosions in moscow apartments blocks when people was rallying around the flag in fear .
[russia] france supplies arms to a lot of nations engaged in even more questionable stuff , it s not going to risk its reputation as an arms dealer .
[russia] ever if he had hired lord voldemort to cast vanishing spell on all his assets and memory charm on all witnesses and accomplices , there would be still satellite images left  httpwww.pravda.com.uarusarticles20130346984712
[us] meanwhile , a government program manager can just point at a contractor and say  i want him out by the end of the day   ease of doing this varies from state to state  .
[us] the even bigger reason is because those identities melded into  white  awhile ago , whereas the whiteblack divide is still a very real thing in the us .
[russia] western media , however , did nt cover this story  since georgia is a us ally  , and instead tried to pass it off as a russian invasion of georgia  some even tried to claim that it was the russians who were bombing tshinval , like the infamous fox news interview  .
[russia] the russian economy has slowed down after years of excellent growth , but you have to remember that russian percapita gdp is way ahead of other brics as it is .
[us] russia acting like they have veto on foreign policy of all countries in europe being quite possibly the most insulting and smug of all of their talking points .
[us] all my records fell off of my shelves and all my furniture was scattered around as if some giant had stirred it all up but nothing was actually broken .
[russia] when even such a minor region as donezk fucking explodes when given a reason , imagine what would happen is the whole of russia were engulfed in revolution .
[us] i would be more than happy to see countries kicked out that think being a part if nato means free american protection while bitching about wasteful military spending .
[us] they may talk with a lisp but they do nt wear a shirt that says  i suck dick and love my boyfriend inside me  .
[russia] each round one of the 13 sectors on the game table is chosen by a spinning top , and in 12 of them there s a letter with a question and a cash prize .
[us] i ve done some research and it seems that , limited though i am here , i would have more opportunities here in the us than in , say , rome , naples , or sicily  where my family is from .
[us] 8  these 10 flaws are so intrinsic to the very system of isds that a reform  as proposed by the european commission  simply can not address them .
[russia] you are ukrainian and i see you posting rather outlandishly antirussian posts sometimes , including iirc arguing that right sector and svoboda were nt nazi at all anymore  or was it another guy
[russia] dagestan certainly does nt  i m one quarter dagestani myself  , and for that matter , many of them dislike chechens  recall that   terrorist   prodemocratic freedom fighter basayev invaded dagestan , which is what triggered the second war  .
[us] i think it s a very legitimate fear for people to have , that they would lose their national identity under a unified state .
[us] i meant more along the lines of  reurope frequently losing their shit because some idiot called themselves  irish  or  italian  or whatever without fully understand the difference in cultural context .
[us] can i overcome this problem while getting along with europeans or should i learn how to deal with people in korea first by overcoming 3040 s japanese military culture and confucianism
[russia] the only time at which the russian army appears to have gotten  directly  involved saw massive regime setbacks and poroshenko agreeing to the ceasefire .
[us] edit    bloomberg , sep 14 , 2013 ,  germany s trade surplus and exports reach alltime highs    httponline.wsj.comnewsarticlessb10001424052702304073204579169454159735052   der spiegel article , oct 31 , 2013 , relaying german reaction  incomprehensible    httpwww.spiegel.deinternationalgermanygermanydefendstradesurplusaftercriticalustreasuryreporta931126.html   germany hits back at us over trade criticism ,  wsj  , oct 31 , 2013   httponline.wsj.comnewsarticlessb10001424052702304073204579169454159735052   paul krugman reaction , nov 3 , 2013 ,  those depressing germans    httpwww.nytimes.com20131104opinionkrugmanthosedepressinggermans.htmlr0   edit 2   the last paragraph in krugman s article   and the thing is , it s not just the germans .
[russia] sure , crimea was immensely important to russian economy and military , and in the long run it would probably better to negotiate a hongkonglike status for it .
[russia] when you are says something in  both sides are guilty  in situation when guilt of sides are incomparable , when one side s actions are criminal , while other side s action are just mistakes  that s victim blaming .
[us] in the hours and days after the tidal waves shuttered the cooling systems , the cores of reactors number 1 , 2 and 3 were in full meltdown and released hydrogen gas , fueling explosions which breached several reactor containment vessels and blew the roof off the building housing reactor number 4 s spentfuel storage pond .
[us] the bottom line is , governments that have these issues and their successors , even after there have been shifts in form of political systems or whatever , almost always have numerous  apparatchiks  who were also associated with the previous regime  and for many other reasons  , they as far as i know ,  never  want to face their pasts honestly so investigations are  always  a cooperative effort on the part of the  global  community .
[us] i m sure a lot of people would like to say they ve been to st. petersburgh and seen the hermitage museum or something along those lines .
[us] rsnackexchange has taught me a lot about what is and is nt allowed into the us and contraband dairy products are on that list .
[russia] someone in vitishko and gazaryan s party who saw the property in 2011 spraypainted  sanya is a thief  on the fence , referring to governor alexander tkachyov .
[us] you even have no idea , not only of what the concept of global public goods actually is , but how you yourself are a recipient of many global public goods supplied by the united states and the united states military .
[russia] if you want to find a photograph of a fake nazi salute , at least find one when the target uses their  right  hand .
[russia] last 15 years kind a indicates that this is exactly what is happening , whether to agree with such course of action or condemn it is a different matter , but  might makes right  is  the  modus operandi lately .
[russia] i really ca nt see why the belief that  slavs are superior than germanics because they re more spiritual  is any less wrong than  germanics are superior than slavs because they re more rational  .
[russia] even if russia is funneling money into svoboda  who knows , would not surprise me  , this is a guy who no doubt believes in what he says and the people from his district apparently support him .
[russia] so it s only me who can see the metro employee badge on this guy , which tell us he is taking the cheese out of the cart and putting it onto the shelves
[us] and here for at least the last few years ,  if not the last few decades  i thought the common european wisdom was that those troops were worthless and the us has troops in germany only to serve american interests
[us] prime is  8.30 a month which is nt much more than netflix or hulu , and unlike netflix  hulu you do nt just get streaming , but music  free 2day shipping as well .
[russia] it is very likely to fare better than the rest of ukraine , especially since putin will pour money into it , and as an oblast  in the russian federation , it will get more of that money into actual projects  and let s not play ignorant here ,  ukraine actually managed to be more corrupt than russia   httpwww.transparency.orgcpi2013results  , which is hardly encouraging  .
[russia] i also found striking of how soviet their mindset is , you walk in their house and you d think they re stuck in the soviet union of 70 s .
[russia] for example in twitter one resident of sloviansk wrote   now i understand what my grandma felt when germans occupied sloviansk  and then  sloviansk got a great vaccine against federalization .
[russia] i remember the fact that no proper investigation has been conducted in regards to sniper shooting and if someone were to kill  100 people i would like to know who exactly did it , how and why .
[us] nord stream    httpen.wikipedia.orgwikinordstreamsecurityandmilitaryaspects   swedish military experts and several politicians , including former minister for defence mikael odenberg , have stated that the pipeline can cause a security policy problem for sweden .
[us] what i meant by that one was that by loosing soldiers he would run the risk of pissing off the public who has been mostly supporting him
[us] and even if they did , the us is nt sitting on a lot of combloc stuff , so giving you guys a bunch of 5.56 and m4s would just confuse your supply chain even more .
[us] the israeli leadership sees the end , and because the arabs can not penetrate much farther into the tel aviv area without enormous loss of life , agrees to an israeli deal that lets the millions of remaining jews to leave the levant .
[us] of course here in the us almost all of the abortion and stem cell protesters are christian , but obviously you can be christian and not be against science .
[russia] believe or not but my own family would be significantly bigger than now if uncle joesph and soviet s were nt exist at all .
[russia] why do these people want them to continue living in an impoverished , not selfsustainable , clearly failed state that is ukraine , which is now ruled my a russophobic rightwing junta
[russia] various ua journalists , activists , wives of the soldiers immediately started to ask to do something with them , to redeploy the encircled deeper in ukraine to make it possible to fire back .
[russia] looking from the inside i do nt see any person who considers stalin or chernobil as something foreign at a time , this all and many other soviet problems are taught in schools as ours problems and it ca nt be different as we all are affected .
[russia] and apparently the best way to  restore the ascendance of the new oligarchy  is to control oligarchs and to push them out of politics .
[us] under the  ambitious  scenario for ttip preferred by eu negotiators , the cepr reveals that at least 1.3 million european workers will lose their jobs as a direct result of the agreement .
[russia] why you are thinking this is very ok to write  slave  on  putin s thugs  but when someone doing the same for you then you call this a crime .
[us] there it can easily be shown that the country could not afford the insurance system , and at the same time pay doctors and nurses a living wage .
[us] this shit might ve been a benefit in the last century when the world revolved around europe  the soviet union was our greatest rival , but it s not the cold war anymore .
[us] the us probably wants to be able to sell gas to europe in the future  even if it ca nt do so right now  .
[russia] nope , these  major news outlets  1  actually publish a lot of bullshit 2  do nt report noteworthy events at all , with or without  double check  .
[us] here are some sources , giving the background to my opinion , which is that the ttip may very well be more beneficial to europe than the us .
[us] also , they blame high us drug prices on the public healthcare in other countries because they claim that forces the companies to shift their costs to the us which they allege spends huge amounts of money on research .
[russia] i had pc since i was like 6 or 7  so i ve had like a lifetime of anglosphere internet , forums , games and so on  and this guy in particular feels wrong .
[russia] note also that it s actually a real ak , and that the first video was recorded in kiev a day or two ago .
[russia] i m guessing that many of critics live in big cities and their opinion has more weight than opinion of usually apathetic people from rural areas .
[us] here in the us even insured people may often have to pay hundreds of dollars  which counts against their deductible which can be as high as  6000  to see a doctor
[russia] however in russia everything is being abused and i wo nt be surprised if this database will be available for sale  besides fact it will be used by bureaucrats for  personal  needs  ...
[russia] dp.ru   httpwww.dp.rua20141027borotsjasomerzeniemmo    russian it companies  are begging the government not to destroy the branch by imposing a new 10  tax on the software developers and retailers .
[russia] the new measures , which are expected to make it harder for russia s big banks and stateowned oil and defense companies to raise capital , should stay in place until putin has carried out all of the essential elements of the ceasefire .
[russia] well , it s pretty clear why putin wants these expensive assault ships , as his navy chief said    if we had these ships , it would ve taken 40 minutes to invade georgia , instead of 26 hours  with turkey , romania , bulgaria and the baltic states already in nato , and ukraine , moldova and georgia fighting for their right to join the civilized world , it would be really stupid to empower putin like that .
[us] the poles and czechs expelled  millions  of germans in the wake of wwii , which had been started partly due to germany s desire to exercise sovereignty over those german minorities .
[us] gundersen says that once a zirconium fuel rod fire has started , the worst thing you could do is to try to quench the fire with water streams , which would cause violent explosions .
[russia] the entire old guard of the former soviet politicians needs to go , once they die off and retire ukraine may finally have a chance to step into the future .
[us] the millions left in the tel aviv area are targeted by chemical and biological weapons , in addition to an artillery barrage that makes the city look like rotterdam in wwii .
[us] its pretty clear to see that the ones integrating more with the west did better  poland , czech republic , slovakia  did better than those that did nt , even if they start from a similar baseline .
[russia] villagers or hired goons is likely , but at the same time , an urban population can be quite prorussian if you are looking at kharkiv or donetsk .
[russia] a lot of people do not believe in kgb s revolt in 1991  conspirators were scared shitless and did nt look like conspirators at all  more like hostages who were forced to play the role  so there is conspiracy theory  he voluntarily gave up ussr to politburo  yeltsin s gang for them to privatize the country while west could declare they ve won cold war .
[us] i do nt consider myself a part of either party  but for the time being , for progress  sake , i tend to lean towards the candidates that are for the most liberal policies  healthcare reform , marriage equality etc  , which tend to be democrats anyway .
[russia] no one bothered to explain why ukraine was so important for customs union or what were the longterm plans for the organization , asking questions is quite unpatriotic in russia nowadays anyway  i do think that russia strategy for ukraine is failing miserably though and has been for quite some time , so with nowadays ukraine  read pretechnical default with 5324658936498 problems  i want nothing to do with .
[russia] eurofags and svidomites  you re late to the party ,  your wahhabi friends have been writing about putin s cancer since 2012   httpwww.kavkazcenter.comengcontent2012112317016.shtml     today i learned from a source in the presidential administration , that our alpha dog is not simply sick but he is sick with spine sarcoma  spinal cancer ,  and 3 months are left for the life of this guy .
[us] not to mention damn near every state has a balanced budget amendment in their constitution   keeping in mind american state economies  populations are relative to many european countries   .
[us] it was chipped away piecebypiece instead of reformed allatonce   thus the last vestiges of hereditary or spiritual peers has always been kept in one form or another , belying any attempt for a democratic mandate to justify increased powers   .
[us] yes , but the guy you were replying to said ireland gives out passports for people who can prove descent , and you said  as does yours my friend .
[russia] they wo nt stop because a lot of them are thinking that southeast is populated by russian bugs , or whatever they call notenoughukranian russian speaking regions .
[russia] twenty years ago , foreign sales of these resources formed 43 percent of russia s exports  as of 2011 , they represented  more than 70 percent .  typical russian liberal propaganda , which never gives the appropriate context  if resource prices increase by a factor of 10 or so , as happened in the past 20 years , then they are almost inevitably going to account for a larger share of total production and exports by value .
[russia] for diplomacy to work interested parties should be presented with  acceptable  scenarios , the question is  what is acceptable for ukraine , eu and russia
[us] because any deviation from the course would mean that they have been wrong for a decade on how to manage fiscal policy and they have been leading all of eurozone into the grave .
[us] i m pretty sure that like many ftas , it is provisionally approved once this preliminary version is presented  then they can work for another one or two years in private changing all sorts of things even as its already in effect .

[russia] plane just crashed , no fucking way that anyone on this video knows that it was a civilian airplane and no one in their right mind would cheer for that .
[russia] not to mention that some people , especially romanians see the eu as the only force to repair their countries as their political elite is so corrupted that without outside help no change will ever happen .

[us] asking midwesterners if they ve left the country is redundant as 95  of the time that answer is no unless they live near canada .
[russia] but back to topic of emigration , i do nt think i represent a typical russian , i was heavily exposed to western world from at least 6 years when i got my zxspectrum , now i am 27 , i have stopped watching russian tv about a decade ago because it was piece of shit , i tend to have a skeptical view and has grown into a cynic .
[russia] a conversation i had with a dane led me into making this topic , i was honestly surprised he had nt heard of whatsapp .

[us] this is really strange position and i only heard this aggressive language from israelis when they talk about obama in  rworldnews  1  you are showing how out of touch you are .
[us] of course most of these issues have died out and the last of the mongoloids have been shunned to the furthest recesses of civilization  they exist but they mostly just exist as outlandish callers on radio shows and are honestly mostly harmless at this point  but the issues that formed some of the violent and negative reputation the south got were mostly due to how the end of the us civil war was handled .
[russia] if you dare to make up your own mind without subscribing to all of their agenda , you are a vatnik retard and communist pawn with a slave mentality .

[russia] the answer is again goes in notion with what was considered normal at the time   spheres of influence and existed treaties  , if russia were to start annexing parts of germany or france , there would be immediately formed a coalition with a goal to stop russia from becoming a dominant power on european continent .
[us] america , for it s civil rights flaws , has probably some of the most accepting free speech rights in the world , and we do nt see significant amounts of violence directed by hate groups  in fact , their membership numbers and activities decline hugely as time progresses .

[russia] current statusquo advocated by our irish friend there is at least the same that was during yushenko years  antirussian  , i would argue much worse though .

[us] the assertions that the various ftas here in the us would create large numbers of jobs  here  or improve the economy are unsupported by the facts .
[us] my main criticism with the thread has been the people that are practically shouting for africans to be killed on sight and hope that they all drown and die .

[us] the only thing it brings to the table is nuclear weapons , and since india and china already have them , that s not really a huge deal .
[russia] it seems kazakhstan is already moving into this direction after recent phrase of putin how kazakhstan was created on a territory which never had any state on it  and belarus is openly exploit customs union to bypass kremlin s selfinflicted sanctions and organize governmentsponsored  contraband  of forbidden products from eu into russian federation .
[us] maybe it would be better if there was a policy to spread these people more evenly throughout europe so that tiny countries do nt get overloaded like sweden and norway .
[russia] i am saying that soviet leadership was  forced  to sign mrp ,  because of all the shit previously combined in one huge menacing picture  for the existence of it .

[russia] you mean ussr moved the border to the west and all  russians  retreat back to rsfsr so nazis will kill all poles  belorussians  ukrainians  jews first
[russia] of course , it s only an assumption but it seems like kremlin has had enough with uncontrolled insurgents and tries to tighten its grasp on military power in the region .

[russia] only to be back several months later when hatred towards newly elected government and imf reforms would grew enough , to stir serious dissent and large enough protests , not couple thousand people .

[us] i m not arguing that china has nt made good progress , but they still have a very , very long way to go .
[us] gats and nafta are particularly useful because they both seem to have been prototype documents which concepts are borrowed from extensively you can and search terms together with a plus sign
[us] you sure are justifying everything they do though and putting everyone else to blame for the mere desire to not live in poverty and be safe from being invaded and to be able to make their own decisions .
[russia] as a final accord , id like to note that nato is u.s led alliance and their agenda not necessarily pursues european union interests .
[russia] russia  , no more meat , only potato now  government has sanctioned its own population and western business with embargo on food import  meat , poultry , dairy products , fruits , vegetables  ,  up to 15  of food was removed in certain segments   httptop.rbc.rueconomics09082014941977.shtmlxtoralinternaltrafficrbc.rumainbodyitem4   government says it will help local production .

[us] the us is socially  as in legal system and social structure  probably closest to the uk if a european nation had to be picked .
[russia] but knowing how much most ukrainians in the west genuinely respect bandera makes me confused as to how you care about them so much .

[russia] but it took them quite some time to do so , so if europe wants to diversify they should also start building , but it still would require  a considerable amount of money and time  .
[russia] however when fsb blames a person that nobody seen in years  that is a very bad sign because it means they do nt have any clues who it really was
[us] overseas shipping is also pretty economical although i agree a pipeline is typically the cheapest alternative short of the oil already being inside of your country .

[russia] vostok  russian   , meaning east   watch makers , inc. produces mainly rugged military and diver mechanical watches at its factory in chistopol , tatarstan , russia .
[us] httpwww.iom.edureports2013ushealthininternationalperspectiveshorterlivespoorerhealth.aspx or httpwww.nap.educatalog.phprecordid13497 stress also effects people healthy lifespans quite a bit . .  this is basically a review paper with dozens of links on stress and the body s responses to it   httpphysrev.physiology.orgcontent873873.long   this shows how stress hastens the cognitive declines of aging   httpwww.sciencenewsline.comarticles2014061811330013.html  so there is a lot to be said for avoiding a  race to the bottom  as best as we can , in both the eu and the us
[us] but he forwarded this proposal to the parties during a meeting in the palace of pedralbes in barcelona and the sovereignist parties see as a last chance to save the 9n .  the government tried , unsuccessfully , that the meeting be discreet and away from the media .
[us] any incident that could come close to overcoming the safety barriers in place is going to destroy a huge amount of infrastructure and kill a large part of the population first , which is precisely what happened in japan .
[russia] the problem obviously is the language barrier , i mean not many people in russia can speak or write in english properly , compared to european population , so it s really hard for foreigners to get an understanding of russian culture and people .
[russia] i am not going to argue that eu is better for ukraine , since i am not a supporter of russian  adventures  in southeastern ukraine .
[russia] it is interesting how chechnya is now a valuable target for terrorists because it s the most prosperous region of russian federation due to enormous financial  help  from kremlin  more like tribute for two civil wars  .
[russia] russian s leader does nt want to accept the loss of influence and control over ukraine and this way started a propaganda campaign against the ukrainians you ca nt break state apart with propaganda alone .
[russia] some shitty tabloid with sole purpose of publishing news on how terrible everything in russia is tells a bizzare story with 0 evidence to back it up and here you are with  you are going to take a lot of shit for it  .
[russia] he s kidding because in russia spying on citizens is legal and every isp and cell services provider has to keep all users  data  loginspasswords , credit card numbers , messages , voice data , etc.
[russia] a person which killed 16 people is getting 6 years term with a right for probation after 3 years , peaceful protesters are being jailed for 25 years for standing in the middle of street with a piece of paper in their hands  same for a  businessmen who go bankrupt and are being accused of fraud   httptop.rbc.ruincidents24082014944624.shtmlxtoralinternaltrafficrbc.rumainbodyitem1  .
[russia] maybe the us and its allies could have tried not encircling russia from three sides with nato bases and abm defenses in contravention of numerous postcold war treaties and understandings
[russia] the system is selfsustaining and if putin suddenly dissapear they will choose a successor like yeltsin  more precisely the family  did , and whoever he would be he would be successfully elected since propaganda and rigged elections are smoothly running mechanisms already .
[us] for example , a possible greek overreaction to turkish claims on greek islands or viceversa  but that was exactly what the guy i m talking about meant when he said   nobody  wants germany to become a normal state . . germany would have to provide for its own security . .  instead of being under the us nuclear umbrella
[us] george s. patton  the early face of  murica  herbert hoover  first he came to save lives with food , but now he s taking them .
[us] as outsized the us military is compared to the rest of natos , it is nt enough to dictate the foreign policy of all the european nato members .
[us] they ll drain the industries of france thanks to more competitive exports from a undervalued exchange rate and then hinder france from recovering by forcing the implementation of austerity without the benefit of fiscal transfers .
[russia] ofc this is  extremely oversimplified  , but russian economy is in deep shit and first signs of that development were seen even in 2013 before any ukrainian events .
[us] you would end up skipping over any chance of keeping a conflict conventional  limited to the baltics to one that s global  ends in wideranging nuclear holocaust .
[us] i get the feeling that this is to give the appearance of a democracy ,  but an overwhelming number of people support it so it s ok  .
[us] if i may pipe in here  i started working in the u.s. house shortly after the 2006 ethics rules were put in , which included a lot of the kind of transparency rules you re talking about .
[us] i m saying that trying to ethnically cleanse the jews , turks , and bulgarians from the disputed regions of macedonia , makes your ethical case incredibly difficult to argue .
[russia] because we re brainwashed zombies , banned on wikipedia and there is a certain lack of  the only correct pov on history  books in russia , right
[russia] even though i do nt consider poland a real country  or anything in space between germany and russia  i have to admit that poles are really most naive  or extremally dumb  people in the world if they really think that licking west boots will do them any good .
[us] not a peep about the thinktank study paid for by the austrian government  that  estimates that as many as 1,000,000 jobs could be lost   httpguengl.euuploadsplenaryfocuspdfassessttip.pdf
[russia] sorry , i have nt done anything like that , i once annexed the toy bear from my friend in the kindergarten and was slapped for that .
[us] anyway , i m getting offtopic , as it s different with spain , as in this scenario it d almost be like going in reverse .
[us] you can cherry pick shit i said all you want , but i honestly do nt think i was even attempting to say  or actually say  even a quarter of what you accuse me of saying .
[us] however it would only take one solar storm to cause dozens of solar meltdowns in its aftermath , look at the refs i just posted which have been downvoted to hide them .
[russia] i do nt know exact size of trailers they ve used in this convoy , but  this   httpwww.toptruck.rutrailers134869  looks pretty similar in size , give or take , and according to specs it has the volume of 60m  3 .
[russia] hundred  of unchecked trucks allowed a big group of abkhazian and chechen troops to sneak past defensive lines of georgians and cut off abkhazia s capital  soukhumi  from mainland georgia .
[russia] russia  , informational vacuum , rumors and news became indistinguishable  press secretary of putin  dismissed rumors about  40b stash his boss has in swiss banks   httptop.rbc.rupolitics20042014919195.shtml   note  there is massive wave of rumors about us promised in geneva to freeze putin s personal assets if russia will break the treaty  and that is why ukraine agreed to sign a deal which looks like obvious trap for them    foreign clients  withdraw 80  of their money   httptop.rbc.rueconomics14042014917637.shtml  from gazprombank , capital continue to escape from the country , for example yandex lost 30  of its value during 4 months   one of sanctioned government s officials  was invited and attended to celebration in paris   httptop.rbc.rupolitics14042014917925.shtml  despite sanctions against him    new icbm   httptop.rbc.rusociety14042014917796.shtml  was launched successfully    government declares the moon will be ours   httptop.rbc.rusociety14042014917796.shtml   there will be a landing 16 years later and followup colony construction .
[us] the name for the one way nature of the ftas is  ratchet  the name for the blockade which blocks any return to public services is  standstill  for example , gats has a standstill clause which you can actually read , here .
[us] you should hope that china s rise stops  that the chinese economy either flatlines , or grows very slowly in the future , and that the china threat never materializes .
[us] watch some shows highlighting minority groups in the us , or documentaries on appalachian , gullah , creole , native , mestizochicano , africanamerican , etc.
[russia] it s serious but it wo nt lead to new cold  war   just a couple  cold battles  maybe  because population of rufed is close to boiling point  it s obvious kremlin has nothing to offer to develop the country  only prayers for higher prices of oil and gas and invasions into nearby countries  , government s bankruptcy andor severe sanctions may spark explosion of separatism .
[us] i admire the swiss people and the country is breathtakingly beautiful  like , serious awesome  but i do nt know who they are fooling with their always ready to fight posture .
[russia] putin has lots of support among the less literate people and the guy probably knew what he was getting into when he wrote that message on his car .
[russia] russia is already paying a hefty price for its  adventures  and it will continue to do so with unknown , unpleasant , unavoidable consequences for time to come , such is life when you are as weak as current rufed is .
[russia] i do point out time and time again , that nothing appears in vacuum and things and relations develop over time between interested parties , what you are trying to do is to portray the world as a clearcut black and white picture , where one side is clearly in the wrong , because it did something .
[russia] perhaps if nato , eu , journalist did nt ignore conflicts in georgia and moldova  today they would nt look stupid when they call these warfare methods  novelty  .
[us] there is no streettostreet fighting and the government condemns the couple of people who attempt to assemble a resistance for fear of provoking a russian response .
[russia] i do nt even feel like giving you a lecture to explain why this is unrealistic idealism , especially since i m sure you know why it is unrealistic .
[us] at least romney would ve responded instead of treating the crimea like putin s rhineland and the donbass like his sudetenland , like obama has .
[us] so no more federal money for highways unless the feds pump alot of other tax funds into it or , you know , we actually raise the gas tax .
[russia] that was just a demonstration that it s incredibly silly to use such pairs of images  good one for one side , bad one for another side  as an argument in any discussion .
[us] and if it makes you feel any better african people are still a very small minority in europe and many african countries are beginning to see economic growth .
[us] but i think you  re seriously delusional if you underestimate it like you do and act like nothing really happened  btw  , it s spelled   renminbi
[us] in other words , why is the socalled polish corridor , which has been polish since 1919 and had an ethnic polish majority before that , the same as the  recovered territories  annexed in 1945
[russia] it helps that they too are their own republic within russia , and they have festivals such as  this   httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiyhyakh  , and traditional culture is preserved as you can see  here   httprbth.commultimediapictures20131224awinterbeautyinthecoldestplaceonearth32523.html
[us] how wonderful would it have been , for example , had europe been able to fully deal with the tsunami in the philippines , with the us navy fully disengaged
[russia] or there was nt any killing and fsb is just lying to public  we can not know this for sure as there are no independent trustworthy media and reporters while authorities are corrupted beyond any comprehension .
[us] there are a million different types of bags going through every day , all with handles in different spots and identical bags can be way different in weight .
[russia] about svoboda   httpwww.vaadua.orgnewspravozashchitnikiosifziselsoevreyahisvobode   edited google translate    in practice , there are really some antisemitic elements in  svoboda  , and we monitor them more than 20 years , since the days when the party was still known as the socialnational party of ukraine .
[russia] interesting how it plays out , but i am tired of the western media insinuating that tatars there are given the treatment of jewish in the germany of the 1930s .
[us] did i not really only get to vote in 2012 because of a court ruling literally the night before the election to block a new voter id law
[us] it is a bit like the early years of the euro debacle , before mr draghi s whateverittakes pledge , when halfsolutions only fed the crisis .
[us] the attitude of only caring about eu to extract whatever benefits an individual country can get while complaining about any possible negatives dooms it to failure .
[us] anytime this topic comes up here it makes usa look like the united socialist states of america compared to the people in eu telling anyone that is poorer than them to go fuck themselves .
[us] when scotland was thinking about seceding i ca nt count the number of times that i talked to scottish people who justified their own secession , but absolutely condemned the idea of the shetlands exercising their own selfdetermination by leaving or choosing to stay with the united kingdom   also of note the shetlands sits ontop of much of that juicy oil   .
[us] just as the waves of privatization which swept eastern europe after the fall of communism served to vastly enrich oligarchs in many countries who were closely associated with organized crime , so the oligarchy in the western nations hopes to be enriched by this new wave of irreversible privatization based on the  most extreme parts   httpwww.wto.orgenglishresebookspeanalyticindexegats03e.htmcomm  of wtogats .
[russia] in other words ...  the eu needs nothing to do with ukraine ... association agreement lists plenty of things to do with ukraine that are certainly beneficial to eu .
[us] well , the us has no reason for people to be included in statistics like most countries in the eu do , so unemployment stats in the us are very inaccurate . .
[russia] the glorious ukrainian spetsnaz never recaptured any of them , because the very next day the  separatists  paraded all six vehicles , still  safely  in their possession .
[russia] the project was in development from october 2013 , and putin himself explained how important is that project on march 25   this document should cause wide public resonance , because culture belongs to all people and each person  .
[russia] could be nice to just escape from russian federation , before authorities will ask me to go to western front to fight against eurogay jew nazis in the name of our glorious leader .
[us] i doubt we would have lost unless you had been willing to simply blockade argentina and use your far superior submarine fleet to send a message ... you would have lsot .
[russia] right , it s like if you do nt socialize with anybody but young educated people you may do nt know in person any putin supporter .
[russia] if anything , russian military were holding guns to ukraine s head , figuratively speaking , because somehow the west did nt cared when ukraine back then in nineties scrapped the autonomy of crimea , ignored crimean referendums  the referendum of 2014 was  third  , ffs  and annexed sevastopol which never belonged to ukraine .
[us] and , even when my cousin spoke to them in italian  has lived in italy her whole life  , they d ask if we were americans .
[russia] us is nt trying to expand their territory by invading canada and mexico  even though they could use  protection of englishmen   reason  for canadian campaign .
[us] the term for the tort that is argued when a government regulates in the public interest and the corporations demand compensation for that  change  is  indirect expropriation  .
[us] so all branches get a say httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiappointmentandconfirmationtothesupremecourtoftheunitedstates  and at last  let former and current political leaders be watched so they wo nt make any shady deals .
[us] well it s just over generalizations so please do nt be offended , but i ve always though the english were a bit arrogant .
[us] in the sense that two different political parties have two completely different views on how a country should be ran ... see  democrats and republicans in the usa  the people who would like it to be a country oh , you mean  these people
[us] although france has cargo aircraft  and even kc135 strategic air refueling aircraft to move its equipment long distances  mobility support is exactly what france received from the us , along with intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance assistance .
[russia] i googled and was not able to find a single mention of these right sector badges before 20 april  for example , it was not mentioned that killed muzychko had any badge .
[us] since it did not hit the earth , though , and also since in 1859 , we only had its effect on the aurora and its effect on telegraph systems to estimate everything else from . . we do nt know anything even remotely as much as we would like .
[us] one thing which i heard about recently might be a good way to do it , you could use tubes , tiny , really tiny tubes .
[russia] i wonder why was that and why russian families had to leave in such a hurry leaving behind their homes , property or selling them for cents
[russia] the wife of one of the troopers started to pretend that her husband is alive , mourning post in her vk was replaced with post claiming that he is alive and well , nameplates on the graves were removed , journalists trying to visit the cemetery were attacked .
[russia] edit  one more variant        httpswww.google.comsearchqd0bcd0b8d188d0bad0b0d0bad0bed181d0bed0bbd0b0d0bfd18bd0b9d188d0bed0bad0bed0bbd0b0d0b4ampsafeoffampclientfirefoxaamphsx8lamprlsorg.mozillaenusofficialamptbmischamptbouampsourceunivampsaxampeieyputoelqnx4atlyydacqampved0ccqqsaqampbiw1461ampbih801    mishka kosolapyi  i do nt know how to translate second word which means  wrongly developed leg  or slang for a bearlike walk  .
[us] i dont know anything about actual shielding against emp , but its kind of interesting so i do think i want to read up more . .
[us] the colonies would nt of revolted if britain had given them the rights they deserved  i have no regrets about the union crushing the confederacy to keep america together .
[us] since it seems like you are interested , the us is also rolling out the new class of destroyers for the navy  httpen.wikipedia.orgwikizumwaltclassdestroyer stealthy and potentially equipped with railguns and lasers . . plus they look badass .
[us] i d have to say that the atrocities of stalin were equal to that of hitler , but trying to find a  winner  between them is ludicrous .
[us] it would be like a nuclear war because the price of food would increase by so many times that millions of children on the planet would die . .
[us] the u.s. is more of a navel and air force power anyway , we will never live to see fields of tanks facing each other in our lifetimes .
[us] its now well known that the drafters at that stage of these things intentionally made them difficult to understand to frustrate any attempt by the public from figuring out their agenda .
[us] when a politician wins over half the votes , the media does nt say they won with less than half the vote by counting people that do nt vote .
[us] the info page linked says     the lead boat is currently used only as a test vessel for testing various equipment , rather than for active duty .
[russia] to ask for an asylum i have to get out of russian federation first while crossing borders without any papers is a bit complicated thing to do .
[us] and the u.s. does seem to make diabetes the course of least resistance for the poor with the loweffort , affordable drinks and snacks .
[russia] but nope , hrw ignored all and every piece of evidence and blamed for this attack ua army   human rights watch investigation on the ground strongly indicates that ukrainian government forces were responsible for the attacks that occurred between july 12 and 21 .
[russia] 90,000 out of a population of 320,000  28.125  90,000 out of reykjavik  regional  population of 200,000  45  on a side note , i ca nt imagine it is easy to live in iceland .
[russia] obviously no one is going to reassess our rearmament programs , dozens of billions of  thrown into world cups ,  mega projects  by staterun companies and other  investments  .
[us] there is a difference between negotiating specific opt outs like the uk versus making and breaking rules you agreed to when you feel like it .
[us] when the israeli leadership realizes no help is coming , they nuke the enemy capitals , but at this point , the arabs just take the loss and refuse to stop .
[russia] if anything you should be terrified that the nazis of europe are fighting their own little personal war in the east , and should want to expose them all
[us] if europe  or rather nato  is really afraid of tensions with russia escalating into a real conflict , then they should work on solving any command chain and logistics issues standing in the way of making effective use of the  very generous  funding they re already receiving .
[russia] you are talking about them as if they all are recent first generation immigrants who came to rich mighty estonia in search of employment .
[us] basically , if the us does it one way , and europe does it a different way , then the us is automatically wrong .
[russia] suddenly , almost everyone has read the article and got inspired   with   by idea to create local republic with its own set of laws , bigger budget  less taxes for kremlin  , and maybe even local army  like in chechnya  .
[russia] here s   httpwww.reddit.comrpolitotacomments26v8qgd181d0b5d0b3d0bed0b4d0bdd18fd0bfd0bed18fd0b2d0b8d0bbd0bed181d18cd0bfd0bed0b4d182d0b2d0b5d180d0b6d0b4d0b5d0bdd0b8d0b5d182d0bed0bcd183d187d182d0bed0b2d181d0b5d182d0b8  a list of some russian media who already wrote about these revealings  some of them are blocked in russia though  , but i ca nt find any serious articles in english .
[russia] prorussians were moved in from other places  minivan had donetsk numbers , one identified person with a gun was a guard from zaporizhia , etc.
[russia] on proputinnationalist sites it probably will be hard to find a single person in comments who support the version that it was done by stalin .
[us] under the  us  defense production act of 1950 , as amended , the secretary of defense and the president have emergency planning authority to requisition essential supplies .
[russia] all stores and cafes work , citizens work , studying in a universities , getting married , getting divorced and dying in one s bed .
[russia] thing is in most cases local food manufacturers partially belong to corrupted bureaucrats  so it look like the state simply removed its foreign competitors to substantially boost income of bureaucrats .
[russia] they know how they got into power , and they know that to stop they need to be attacking new movements similar to their what their own was , with military force .
[russia] make sure to have someone filming  preferably from a discrete , hidden position  who will then put it up on youtube for our entertainment .
[us] i read an article not that long ago that stated germany s military exists in name only due to all the long past due maintenance that keeps most of the hardware offline .
[us] nato in turn , knows that the russian show of force is mostly show and it should not overreact in any manner that may tip actual capabilities , which in turn allows nato to assess the performance of each of their members in actual confrontations , though lowlevel as they may be .
[us] though i ve never been to southern croatia  such as dubrovnik  , there are plenty of regional , village , and island specific dialects that any  native  croatserbbosniak would have trouble comprehending .
[us] this is useful , worth saving and keeping in order to understand these fta schedules . . httpwww.normangirvan.infowpcontentuploads200911kelsey1howtoreadaschedule1.pdf bear in mind , its both old , and its about another fta . . however , its an fta gats , which ttip explicitly refers to .
[us] saddam was regularly trying to make things difficult on weapons inspectors and would fire on planes in the no fly zone he agreed to.of course it was nt anywhere close to the threat being put forth by bush though .
[russia] it s neither neutral nor correct   rebels  arrived from a foreign country , controlled by a foreign country , armed by a foreign country , oh yeah  .
[russia] i think its better than blowing up schools , capturing musical theaters , bombing metro s and train stations , bus routes and all the other wonderful things that these people were engaged in .
[us] it s just as fucked up as if i put on a scottish flag and started railing against independence , or if i used a catalonian flag to fiercely stress the importance of spanish integrity .
[us] despite an extremely underutilized labor force , approximately 27 percent of job vacancies created each year in the major european economies go unfilled because of a lack of appropriately skilled applicants .
[us] we have so many advantages  for example , size of population , one language throughout all 50 states , relative ease of moving from one part of the us for a job to another  its not even worth mentioning .
[russia] from the point of view of western public that is predominantly represented here , the difference between russia , russian government and russians is indistinguishable .
[us] claiming that pointing out how europe has fucked over and benefits from africa is somehow support for mugabe by extension is fucking insanity as well .
[us] that goes to the 170,000 croats and nonserbs forced out of their homes in serbia krajina as i stated in a previous reply to you .
[russia] he lamented the fact that turkey has put up with europe s condescending attitude for years , allowing itself to be used and burdened .
[russia] what if you were to create something like a political tv show with 2 opposing viewpoints being presented by a number of experts and counterarguments for each other
[russia] on the other hand ukraine showed that you can takeover the corrupted state without a massive disasters , we surely have china which can play like russia did in ukrainian conflict but i hope they have no territorial claims after putin gave them thousands km  2 worth of islands they were asking for for a century .
[russia] if the ethnic polish of ukraine started a separatist movement of their own , poles would cross the border of their own free will to help them .
[russia] also , ukraine has its own big military industry that is able to produce a lot of stuff from sniper rifles to tanks , there were a lot of time to revive it  i see some steps in this direction , e.g.
[us] thats good but at the same time ,  i can not overestimate how much the health care situation in the us is keeping americans who would like to return home , away .
[us] the only reason they ve managed to stay there is because of germany s staunch refusal to consider fiscal transfers to help bolster southern industries  economies while being adamant about the implementation of austerity , thus basically keeping the south on their knees  killing any hope of a sustainable recovery .
[russia] 5  unemployment sounds great on paper , but i m afraid that its sort a like germanamerican statistics , semitruth with shades of gray , part time jobs , part of madeup numbers .
[russia] to compare  during 2008 crisis economy lost  90b euro   progovernment organization  some call them  putlerjugend    displayed giant banner with list of  fifth column activists  in moscow   httpgrani.rupoliticsrussiam.228750.html  .
[russia] this government does nt react to citizens  initiatives in timely manner until material damage is done  be it riotspogroms or terrorist acts  and certain people see these methods as the only way to change anything in this country .
[us] do nt really have any idea where pop music is these days but it seems like they ve gone completely off the deep end .
[us] now lets flip the situation , you  assuming you re from europe  are prejudiced agains because you are nt one of the group ... not being one of us is nt a logical reason pre judge someone
[russia] but you need to be either blind or completely brainwashed by the western media if you believe that maidan consists of freedomloving peaceful protesters who will bring prosperity to ukraine .
[russia] we are nt welloff like the western oecd nations , every increase in the bread , meat , gas , electricity prices  all of this is a very real problem for us .
[russia] second , about stalingrad what he said is that according to russian laws , it must be decided by the people living in the city .
[russia] i m  afraid  dear leader will remove migrants from the country so muscovites will have to work as low wage workers themselves  it may actually kill the economy because  10 millions foreign migrants are  20  of work force  .
[us] or were , at least  isis does nt need much money now that they re raking in hundreds of millions from illicit oil revenue and taxes in iraq and syria .
[russia] i distanced myself from the conflict several months ago , due to immense amount of propaganda and lies from both sides , so no  i am not justifying anything or anyone .
[russia] brief history in checnya after fall of ussr   all xssr  like belarus ssr , ukraine ssr etc  hold a referendum and decide to quit ussr .
[russia] these people know that they are criminals and if something would go wrong  lost control  they would flee from russia with all their capitals to avoid retribution .
[russia] it s not a line of reasoning , it s a link to the wikipedia s article that does nt support any absurd claims you made .
[us] your complaint specifically was an attack on usa which is utter bullshit considering your complaints have everything to do with europeans and their desire to hate military spending .
[us] the good news for germany is that its more active international allies like britain , france and the usa are used to its habit of overpromising and underdelivering .
[us] but , a lot of things are made of the us system , and i m honestly not intending to start a circlejerk here   people get a worthless degree .
[us] hitler tried to copy italian fascism , but the most odious component , his racial theories that led to the holocaust , were his own .
[us] well that or their opponent responds with their own tactical nukes   the potential of which can also act as a deterrent in itself   , and russia responds back , and then so on  so on until the icbms are launched and we re all facing nuclear holocaust .
[russia] however i think police officer may lie about imitation of heart attack  there is high chance they just left the guy unattended and are trying to cover their arses with heart attack story .
[us] oh , in mine it was that if you do nt finish everything you ca nt get up from the table , so for about a month the teacher and i had a standoff .
[russia] i am pretty tired and drunk right now , so i ca nt provide immediate examples  nor do i store them in an attempt to expose  western lies and hypocrisy   , i will try to dig up some stuff tomorrow .
[us] uga is a fine school but there is still a bit of a  dying  negative stigma of going to a public school instead of private .
[us] edit  china also backed russia by refusing to ensure their actions in ukraine and raping them on a trade deal after russia was desperate to look like they could get by fine without eu .
[russia] they could be a joint venture between estonia and latvia to push their agenda and ideology to russian speakers , both in the baltics and russia proper .
[us] i would nt say they hated germans , but they vowed never to buy anything from germany , and my grandfather got very upset when his brother bought a mecedes .
[us] also , i was born in the south but both of my parents were from the north and only 1 branch of my family tree were even in the us for the civil war .
[russia] the rest of the world will be screwed because we have the biggest amount of nuclear weapons , and , should the federation fall , some will almost certainly fall into radical hands
[us] do nt look at me as a person with a opinion , disregard my opinion entirely because i m american  mock me for being american .
[russia] so , russia s government heavily relies on nationalism for support , and in a way , the west s actions over the past 20 years are responsible for the presence of such nationalism .
[russia] it s a parody of us officials  statements about russia  the first sentence , for example , is a reference to john kerry   you just do nt in the 21st century behave in 19th century fashion by invading another country
